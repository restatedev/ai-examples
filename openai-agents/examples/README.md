# Restate and OpenAI Agents SDK for Python

This repository contains examples of using Restate with OpenAI Agents in Python.

**First, check out the basic examples in the [Tour of AI Agents with Restate](https://github.com/restatedev/ai-examples/tree/main/openai-agents/tour-of-agents).**

To get started, cd into any of the examples and then run them:

```shell
uv run . 
```


Run Restate and register the service, similar to [the AI Quickstart](https://docs.restate.dev/ai-quickstart#python-%2B-openai). 

Then invoke the agents that were registered, via the UI playground, using their default messages. 

Check the Restate journal to see how the agents executed their steps durably.
