# Resilient agents with Restate + OpenAI Agents Python SDK
[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restatedev/img/refs/heads/main/show-code.svg">](agent.py)

Use the OpenAI Agent SDK to implement your agent, and let Restate handle the persistence and resiliency of the agent's decisions and tool executions.

The example is an agent that can search for the weather in certain city.

## Running the example

1. Export your OpenAI or Anthrophic API key as an environment variable:
    ```shell
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ```
2. [Start the Restate Server](https://docs.restate.dev/develop/local_dev) in a separate shell:
    ```shell
    restate-server
    ```
3. Start the services:
    ```shell
    cd openai_sdk
    uv run .
    ```
4. Register the services: 
    ```shell
    restate -y deployments register localhost:9080
    ```

5. Send requests to your agent:

    ```shell
    curl localhost:8080/Agent/run --json '"What is the weather in Detroit?"'
    ```
    
    Returns: `The weather in Detroit is currently 22Â°C and sunny.`


Check the Restate UI (`http://localhost:9080`) to see the journals of your invocations (remove the filters).

## Integrating Restate with the OpenAI Python Agent SDK

To make the agent resilient, we need to:
- Persist the results of LLM calls in Restate's journal by wrapping them in `ctx.run()`. This is handled by the `RestateModelProvider`.
- To persist the intermediate tool execution steps, we pass the Restate context along to the tools.

## Limitations
1. You cannot do parallel tool calls or any type of parallel execution if you integrate Restate with an Agent SDK. 
If you execute actions on the context in different tools in parallel, Restate will not be able to deterministically replay them because the order might be different during recovery and will crash. 
We are working on a solution to this, but for now, you can only use Restate with Agent SDKs for sequential tool calls.

2. Restate does not yet support streaming responses from the Vercel AI SDK.
