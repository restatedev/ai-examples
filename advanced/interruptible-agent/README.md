# Restate Interruptible Agent

This example implements an agent whose work can be interrupted when new input become available.


Important files:
- [`chat.py`](app/chat.py): The chat service, which receives the user input and agent responses. Based on the selected operational mode, it interacts differently with the ongoing agent runs on new inputs. 
The chat session is keyed by the user ID. 
- [`agent.py`](app/agent.py): The agent session which executes the customized agent loop.

The agent has three modes:
- **INTERRUPT**: The current agent run will be canceled when a new user input is received. A new run will be started. You could implement a rollback mechanism to restore the previous state.
- **INCORPORATE**: On its next iteration, the agent will check if a new user input has been received. If so, it will incorporate the new input into its current state and continue running.
- **QUEUE**: The current agent will continue running. The new user input will be queued as a new agent run request and will be processed after the current agent run is finished.

You could adapt this example to let every user set his preferred way of interacting with agents. 

## Why Restate?

The main features of Restate that this example shows are:
- ðŸŽ® **Task control** - Cancel tasks, retrieve tasks and send them more inputs on which they can act.
- ðŸ“¨ **Durable Promises** - Create a resilient promise that can be resolved from the outside, and can be recovered across processes and time. 
- ðŸ’¾ **Persistent memory** - Maintain session state across infrastructure events. The chat session tracks ongoing agent runs and interacts with them when it receives new inputs.
- ðŸ”§ **Flexibility and customization** - Customize your agent implementations to your needs without sacrificing resiliency.

## Running the example

Start the service:
```shell
MODE=INCORPORATE uv run app
```
or use `MODE=INTERRUPT` or `MODE=QUEUE`.

Start Restate:
```shell
restate-server
```

Open the UI on http://localhost:9070 and register your deployment running at `http://localhost:9080`, or do:

```shell
restate -y deployments register localhost:9080 --force
```

Then, start a task:

```shell
curl localhost:8080/ChatService/peter/process_user_message --json '{
  "content": "Prepare a burger and a caesar salad.",
  "role": "user"
}'
```

A bit later, start a new task:

```shell
curl localhost:8080/ChatService/peter/process_user_message --json '{
  "content": "Oh, and please add some croutons to the salad!",
  "role": "user"
}'
```

Depending on the mode you selected, the behavior will be different.

You can see the chat history by executing:
```shell
curl localhost:8080/ChatService/peter/get_chat_history
```

You will see the agent response after a while.


### `INCORPORATE` mode

In this mode, the agent will check if a new user input has been received on its next iteration. If so, it will incorporate the new input into its current state and continue running.

If you send a few messages to the same session, you will see the logs printing the new user input:

```

Depending on how you want to handle the new input, you can also choose to cancel the current iteration (by pulling it into a Service handler) and start a new one with the new input. 


### `INTERRUPT` mode

In this mode, the current agent will be canceled when a new user input is received. A new run will be started. You could implement a rollback mechanism to restore the previous state ([see saga guide](https://docs.restate.dev/guides/sagas)).

Start the service with `MODE=INTERRUPT`.

To start from a clean slate, use a different chat session name (e.g. `ella` instead of `ella`).

```shell
curl localhost:8080/ChatService/ella/process_user_message \
  --json '{
  "content": "Prepare a burger and a caesar salad.",
  "role": "user"
}'
```

A bit later, start a new task:

```shell
curl localhost:8080/ChatService/ella/process_user_message \
  --json '{
  "content": "Oh, and please add some croutons to the salad!",
  "role": "user"
}'

If you send a few messages to the same session, you will see the cancellation in the logs and the UI will show only the new task.

### `QUEUE` mode

In this mode, the new tasks get queued. If you send a few messages to the same session, you will see the pending tasks in the UI.

Start the service with `MODE=QUEUE`. And use again a different chat session name (replace `peter`).
