# Resilient agents with Restate
In these examples, we show how to use Restate (optionally together with Agent SDKs) to build scalable, resilient agent sessions.


### Option 1: Restate + Agent SDK
[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restatedev/img/refs/heads/main/show-code.svg">](openai_sdk/agent.py)

Combine Restate's durability with existing Agent SDKs for rapid development.

We use Restate's stateful entities called Virtual Objects to manage the session state and retries for us.

### Option 2: Native Restate Implementation
[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restatedev/img/refs/heads/main/show-code.svg">](native_restate/agent.py)

Implement the agent loop directly with Restate for maximum control and resilience.

**This gives your agentic workflow the same resiliency and capabilities as what you get with a "traditional" workflow.**

**The agent composes the workflow on the fly, and Restate persists the execution as it takes place.**

If we implement the agent loop with Restate, Restate journals each of the decisions the agents make and manages the tool executions.
The agent session is a Restate Virtual Object that has a handler that runs the agent loop.

### üéØ **Recommendation**

- **Choose Restate + Agent SDK** for: Quick prototypes, proof of concepts, or when you don't want to manage the agent loop yourself.
- **Choose Native Restate** for: Production systems, customized agent loops, complex workflows, applications requiring fine-grained control, or long-running agent processes.


## Running the examples

### Restate + Agent SDK 
[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restatedev/img/refs/heads/main/show-code.svg">](openai_sdk/agent.py)

This example implements an airline customer service agent that can answer questions about your flights, and change your seat.

The example uses the OpenAI Agent SDK to implement the agent. Although this could be adapted to other agent SDKs.


1. Export your OpenAI or Anthrophic API key as an environment variable:
    ```shell
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ```
2. [Start the Restate Server](https://docs.restate.dev/develop/local_dev) in a separate shell:
    ```shell
    restate-server
    ```
3. Start the services:
    ```shell
    uv run openai_sdk
    ```
4. Register the services: 
    ```shell
    restate -y deployments register localhost:9080 --force
    ```
   

Now you can send requests to the agent via the UI playground (click on the agent service and then `playground`):

<img src="img/ui_openai.png" alt="UI example" width="1000px"/>

Or with the [client](client/__main__.py):

- **Request**: 
   
   ```shell
    uv run client "how much can my bag weigh?"          
   ```
   
   Example response: `Your bag can weigh up to 50 pounds and should not exceed the dimensions of 22 inches x 14 inches x 9 inches.`

- **Request**: 
   
   ```shell
   uv run client "can you change my seat to 10b?"
   ```
   
   Example response: `To change your seat to 10B, I'll need your confirmation number. Could you please provide that?`

- **Request**: 
   
   ```shell
   uv run client "5666"                         
   ```
   
   Example response: `Your seat has been successfully changed to 5B. If there's anything else you need, feel free to ask!`



### Restate-native example
[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/restatedev/img/refs/heads/main/show-code.svg">](native_restate/agent.py)

This example implements a bank agent that can answer questions about your balance, loans and transactions.

1. Export your OpenAI key as an environment variable:
    ```shell
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ```
2. [Start the Restate Server](https://docs.restate.dev/develop/local_dev) in a separate shell:
    ```shell
    restate-server
    ```
3. Start the services:
    ```shell
    uv run native_restate
    ```
4. Register the services: 
    ```shell
    restate -y deployments register localhost:9080 --force
    ```
   
Now you can send requests to the agent via the UI playground (click on the agent service and then `playground`):

<img src="img/ui_example.png" alt="UI example" width="1000px"/>

Or with the [client](client/__main__.py):

- **Request**: 
   ```shell
   uv run client "how much is my balance?"
   ```
   Example response: `Your current balance is $100,000.00. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask!`

- **Request**:
   ```shell
   uv run client "how much did I spend on gambling last month?"
   ```
   Example response: `I reviewed your transactions from last month, and it appears you didn't spend any money on gambling during that period. If you have any other questions or need further clarification, please let me know!`

- **Request**: 
   
   ```shell
   uv run client "give me an overview of my outstanding loans and credit"
   ```
   
   Example response:
   ```
   Here's an overview of your outstanding loans:
   
   1. **Car Purchase Loan**
      - **Amount**: $10,000
      - **Duration**: 12 months
      - **Approved**: Yes
      - **Reason**: Good credit score and no risky transactions like gambling.
      - **Monthly Payment**: $9,856.07
      - **Months Left**: 11
   
   If you need more information, feel free to ask!
   ```
   
You can see the state of your agent in the state tab in the UI:
