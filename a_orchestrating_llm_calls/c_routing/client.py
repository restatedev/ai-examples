Subject: Unexpected charge on my card
    Message: Hello, I just noticed a charge of $49.99 on my credit card from your company, but I thought

Billing Support Response:

Hello Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the unexpected charge on your credit card. I understand your concern about the $49.99 charge when you were expecting to be billed $29.99.

Upon reviewing your account, it appears that the charge of $49.99 is due to an upgrade to a higher-tier plan that was activated on your account. This plan includes additional features and benefits that are not available in the $29.99 plan. It's possible that this upgrade was selected inadvertently.

To resolve this issue, here are the next steps:
1. If you did not intend to upgrade, please confirm this by replying to this message, and we will revert your account back to the $29.99 plan.
2. Once confirmed, we will process a refund for the difference of $20.00. This refund will be initiated within 2 business days and should reflect on your credit card statement within 5-7 business days, depending on your bank's processing time.

If you wish to continue with the upgraded plan, no further action is needed, and you will continue to enjoy the additional features.

For your convenience, we accept payments via credit card, debit card, and PayPal. Please let us know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.

Thank you for your understanding and patience.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Billing Support Specialist

Subject: How to export data?
    Message: I need to export all my project data to Excel. I've looked through the docs but can't

    Best regards,

Technical Support Response:

1. **Verify System Requirements:**
   - Ensure you have the latest version of the software installed.
   - Confirm that Microsoft Excel (version 2010 or later) is installed on your system.

2. **Access the Export Function:**
   - Open the application where your project data is stored.
   - Navigate to the "Projects" section or the specific area where your data is located.

3. **Select Data for Export:**
   - If the application allows, select all projects or the specific projects you wish to export.
   - Look for an "Export" or "Export Data" option, typically found in the toolbar or under a "File" or "Options" menu.

4. **Choose Export Format:**
   - When prompted, select "Excel" or ".xlsx" as the export format.
   - If the option is available, choose "Bulk Export" to export all project data at once.

5. **Initiate Export:**
   - Click on the "Export" button to start the process.
   - Choose a destination folder on your computer where the Excel file will be saved.

6. **Verify Exported Data:**
   - Once the export is complete, navigate to the chosen destination folder.
   - Open the Excel file to ensure all project data has been exported correctly.

7. **Common Workarounds:**
   - If the bulk export option is not available, consider exporting projects individually and then merging them in Excel.
   - If you encounter any errors, try restarting the application and repeating the steps.

8. **Escalation Path:**
   - If you continue to experience issues or if the export feature is not functioning as expected, please contact our technical support team at [support@example.com](mailto:support@example.com) or call us at 1-800-555-0199 for further assistance.

Please let us know if you need any additional help.
