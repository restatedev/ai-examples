=== GENERATION START ===
Thoughts:

The task requires implementing a stack with three operations: push, pop, and getMin, all in constant time complexity, O(1). A common approach to achieve this is by using two stacks: one for storing the actual stack elements and another for keeping track of the minimum elements. This ensures that each operation can be performed in constant time. There is no feedback to consider, so I will proceed with this approach.


Generated:

```python
class MinStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []
        self.min_stack = []

    def push(self, x):
        self.stack.append(x)
        # Push the new minimum onto the min_stack
        if not self.min_stack or x <= self.min_stack[-1]:
            self.min_stack.append(x)

    def pop(self):
        if self.stack:
            top = self.stack.pop()
            # If the popped element is the minimum, pop it from the min_stack as well
            if top == self.min_stack[-1]:
                self.min_stack.pop()

    def getMin(self):
        # The current minimum is the top of the min_stack
        if self.min_stack:
            return self.min_stack[-1]
        return None
```

=== GENERATION END ===

=== EVALUATION START ===
Status: PASS
Feedback: 
The code correctly implements a stack with push, pop, and getMin operations, all in O(1) time complexity. The use of an auxiliary stack (`min_stack`) to keep track of the minimum values ensures that the getMin operation is efficient. The code follows good style and best practices, with clear method names and appropriate use of data structures. No improvements are necessary.
