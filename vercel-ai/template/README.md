# Restate + Vercel AI Example (non-NextJS)

This is template of a simple agent written with the Vercel AI SDK and using Restate for resilience and observability.

This example is for deployments where the agent is served directly, and not as part of a NextJS app.
Use this template when deploying the agent on generic containers, FaaS (Lambda, Fly.io, etc.) or for simply experimenting locally.

## Running the template example

1. Export your OpenAI key as an environment variable. If you want to use another model (e.g., Anthrophic Claude, Google Gemini) you need to change the dependencies in `package.json` and the model in `src/app.ts` accordingly:
    ```shell
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ```
2. [Start the Restate Server](https://docs.restate.dev/develop/local_dev) in a separate shell. The server is the durable orchstrator. It is queue, workflow engine, k/V store in one.
    ```shell
    npx @restatedev/restate-server@latest
    ```
3. Start the services. This is the agent code.
    ```shell
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
4. Register the services, to let Restate Server know about the agent. The Server can now proxy invocations to the agent, adding durable execution that way.
    ```shell
    restate -y deployments register localhost:9080
    # or, if you don't have the CLI
    curl localhost:9070/deployments --json '{"uri": "http://localhost:9080"}'
    ```

5. All should be ready. Now send a request to your agent. Note that we target Restate Server's endpoint (8080) because the server proxies requests to the service, to make them durable.

    ```shell
    curl localhost:8080/Agent/run --json '"What is the weather in Detroit?"'
    ```

   Returns: `The weather in Detroit is currently 22Â°C and sunny.`

Check the Restate UI (`localhost:9080`) to see the journals of your invocations (you may need to remove the filters that filter out completed invocations).

## Limitations

- The Vercel SDK wraps all errors that come out of tool calls. That means `TerminalErrors` from tools currently turn into transient errors.
