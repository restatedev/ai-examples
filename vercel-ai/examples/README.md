# Restate + Vercel AI SDK Examples

This repository contains examples of using Restate with AI SDK in TypeScript.

**First, check out the basic examples in the [Tour of AI Agents with Restate](https://github.com/restatedev/ai-examples/tree/main/vercel-ai/tour-of-agents).**

To get started, run:

```shell
uv run .
```

Run Restate and register the service, similar to [the AI Quickstart](https://docs.restate.dev/ai-quickstart).

Then invoke the agents that were registered, via the UI playground, using their default messages.

Check the Restate journal to see how the agents executed their steps durably.
