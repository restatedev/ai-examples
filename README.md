# Restate: SDK-agnostic resilient agentic workflows 

Restate turns brittle agents into **resilient agents**.

Restate is Agent-SDK-agnostic and turns your agentic workflows into **reliable applications** that work consistently in production.

Restate has got your back: whether you start by adding resiliency to an existing agent SDK, or decide the agent SDK not flexible enough and implement everything from scratch while keeping your resiliency guarantees.


## Restate + Vercel AI SDK

**[<img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=ts" width="24" height="24"> Minimal template](get-started/vercel-ai)**

For a more advanced example that can be deployed as a Next.js app on Vercel, check out this [Vercel AI SDK example](agents/vercel-ai-sdk/README.md).

## Restate + OpenAI Agent SDK
**[<img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=python&theme=light" width="24" height="24"> Minimal template](get-started/openai-agents-python)**

For a more advanced example (including handoffs etc.), check out this [OpenAI Agent SDK example](agents/openai-agents-python/README.md).

## Why Restate?
[Restate](https://ai.restate.dev/) lets you easily build **reliable applications** that work consistently in production. 
Restate's capabilities and programming model work very well for implementing **agentic workflows**.
Move beyond fragile demos by giving your agents **innate resilience**‚Äîpersistent memory, fault-tolerant tool/LLM calls, and robust handling of long-running tasks. Focus on your agent's intelligence, not the infrastructure complexity tax.

Restate provides the following capabilities:
- üöÄ **Move fast and far** - Innate resiliency and control from your first LLM-SDK-based app to low-level, customized multi-agent applications.
- ‚úÖ **Resilience where it matters most** ‚Äì Automatically recover from failures in your agentic workflows and tools.
- üéÆ **Task control** - Cancel tasks, query status, re-subscribe to ongoing tasks, and track progress across failures, time, and processes.
- ü§ñ **Reliable multi-agent** - Flexible and reliable communication patterns including RPC, scheduled tasks, events, human-in-the-loop and parallel execution.
- üëÄ **Full observability** ‚Äì Line-by-line execution tracking with a built-in audit trail and UI. Seamless integration with OpenTelemetry.
- üîÅ **Orchestrate long-running processes** ‚Äì Coordinate durable and stateful agentic processes for millis or months.
- üîß **Rich primitives** ‚Äì Leverage workflows, durable promises, communication, and persistent state.
- üß† **Exactly-once execution** - Automatic deduplication of hand-offs and tool executions via idempotency keys.
- üíæ **Persistent memory** - Maintain consistent agent memory across infrastructure events.
- üåç **Deploy anywhere** ‚Äì Whether it's AWS Lambda, CloudRun, Fly.io, Cloudflare, Kubernetes, Deno Deploy,...
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Easy to self-host** ‚Äì Single-binary self-hosted deployments or connect to [Restate Cloud](https://restate.dev/cloud/).

Restate can also be used for other use cases, such as: 
[workflows](https://docs.restate.dev/use-cases/workflows),
[microservice orchestration](https://docs.restate.dev/use-cases/microservice-orchestration),
[async tasks](https://docs.restate.dev/use-cases/async-tasks), 
and [event processing](https://docs.restate.dev/use-cases/event-processing).
Or check out the [Restate examples repository](https://github.com/restatedev/examples).

This repository contains examples of how to use Restate for AI / Agent use cases.

## How Restate Compares (vs. Alternatives for Agents):

- **vs. DIY (Basic Loops + DB/Queue)**: Eliminates vast amounts of boilerplate code for retries, state management, consistency checks, and failure recovery that developers would otherwise need to build manually.
- **vs. Basic Agent Frameworks (focused on prompts/reasoning)**: Provides the crucial missing layer of execution reliability, state persistence, and robust async operation management needed for production. Restate complements these frameworks by providing a reliable runtime beneath the agent's reasoning logic.
- **vs. Heavy Workflow Engines:** Offers similar strong execution guarantees but with a lighter footprint, lower latency, simpler programming model, native serverless integration, and easier self-hosting/operational story‚Äîoften a better fit for the potentially high-volume, interactive nature of agent applications.
