# Restate AI Agents examples

This repository contains examples of how to use Restate for AI / Agent use cases.

Restate gives many benefits when implementing LLM-based applications and agents. 
In this ReadMe we describe a few options on how to integrate Restate with existing AI SDKs.

The integration goes from loose integration (calling LLMs or Agent SDKs from Restate actions) to tight integration (implementing long-running multi-agent setups with Restate constructs).

The options:
1. [DIY patterns: Using Restate to orchestrate LLM calls](diy-patterns)
2. [Agents: Using Restate (together with Agent SDKs) for agentic workflows](agents)
3. [A2A: Implementing resilient A2A servers with Restate](a2a)
4. [End-to-end applications: examples of agentic Restate applications](e_a2a)

# Disclaimers and acknowledgements

**Disclaimer 1**: The implementations of the agent loops in this repo are heavily inspired by the [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python). 
We therefore want to give credit to the developers of this SDK for the great work they have done.
This repo builds further on their work to make it benefit from Restate's programming model and capabilities.

**Disclaimer 2**: For the DIY patterns, we based ourselves on Anthropic's [agents cookbook](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/patterns/agents).

**Disclaimer 3**: The chat UI code in the `tooling/chat-ui` folder was generated by [v0 by Vercel](https://v0.dev/). 
It is only meant for demo purposes and in no way a recommended way to implement chat sessions in combination with Restate agents.
