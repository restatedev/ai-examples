# Examples for AI workflows and Durable Agents

This repo contains a set of runnable examples of AI workflows and agents, using  **Durable Execution and Orchestration** via [Restate](https://restate.dev/) ([Github](https://restatedev/restate))

The goal is to show how you can easily add production-grade _resilience_, _state persistence_, _retries_, _suspend/resume_, _human-in-the-loop_, and _observability_ to agentic workflows. So you can ship agents that stay alive and consistent without sprinkling retry-code everywhere and without building heavyweight infra yourself.

The Restate approach works **independent of specific SDKs** but **integrates easily with popular SDKs**, like the [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) or the [OpenAI Agent SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/). You can also use without and Agent SDK _(roll your own loop)_ or for more traditional workflows.

ðŸ“„ A gentle intro is in [the blog post "Durable Agents - Fault Tolerance across Frameworks and without Handcuffs"](https://restate.dev/blog/durable-ai-loops-fault-tolerance-across-frameworks-and-without-handcuffs/)

### Roll your own Loop? AI-enriched workflows?

Restate is a flexible general-purpose runtime for what we call _innately resilient application_. It is not limited to agentic workflow use cases and is being used for a variety of other use cases as well, including financial transactions or order processing. These examples show how to build agents directly on Restate's durable execution and state management:

## Use Cases

| Use Case                           | What it solves                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Durable Execution**              | Crash-safe LLM/tool calls & idempotent retriesâ€”agents resume at the last successful step.   |
| **Journal Observability**          | Auto-captured journal of every step, retry, and message for easy debugging and auditing.    |
| **Human-in-the-loop & long waits** | Suspend while waiting for user approval or slow jobs; pay for compute, not wall-clock time. |
| **Stateful sessions / memory**     | Virtual Objects keep multi-turn conversations and other state isolated and consistent.      |
| **Multi-agent orchestration**      | Reliable RPC, queuing, and scheduling between agents running in separate processes.         |
