# Chat UI

This UI is a simple chat interface for interacting with an agent.

It was generated with [v0 by Vercel](https://v0.dev/) and is only meant for demo purposes, to have a quick way to interact with the agent.

This UI does not in any way reflect our recommended way of implementing chat sessions in combinations with agents.

## Running the UI   

```shell
npm i 
npm run dev
```


This UI can be used in combination with some of the examples in this repository that implement a `ChatService`:
- [Agents examples](../agents) 
- Some of the [end-to-end applications](../end-to-end-applications)

You can find the detailed instructions for running the examples in the respective folders.
